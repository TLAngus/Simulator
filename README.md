# Simulator
The purpose of the **Simulator** project is to have a grid which you can use to simulate the behaviour of programmed entities. You can place different types of Entities on those cells using the editor, and lateron *play* that simulation.  
You can also save those *simulations* on a remote server, and use the Simulation Player to play a desired simulation.  
Also there's an Android application which can be used to play simulations that are stored on the remote server.
